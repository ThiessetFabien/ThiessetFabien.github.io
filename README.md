# My Personal Portfolio created with :heart: using Next.js by Thiesset Fabien

This portfolio is based on my next.js template. It is a simple portfolio with a light and dark theme. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more features to it in the future.

This projet uses the following technologies: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint-Staged, and PostCSS.
