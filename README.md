# My Personal Portfolio created with :heart: using Next.js by Thiesset Fabien

This portfolio is based on my next.js template. It is a simple portfolio with a light and dark theme. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more features to it in the future.

This projet uses the following technologies: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint-Staged, and PostCSS.

---

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Format the code:

```bash
pnpm run format
```

Lint the code:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

Build the local project:

```bash
pnpm run build:local
```

Build the project:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
